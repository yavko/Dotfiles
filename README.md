# Cat NixOS dots
> loosely copied from @fufexan's[^fuf] dots

My Catppuccin[^cat] dotfiles written in nix, managed with home-manager[^hm]

## Meta

### Usage
```sh
nixos-rebuild switch --flake . --use-remote-sudo
```

### OS Support
Only NixOS is supported as of now, no nix-darwin, no NixNG, and no generic linux

### Screenshots
Don't exist, because I don't feel this is unique enough to be 
shown off ATM, this is just so I have a public place to show
my dots, but in the near future, that will not be the case ðŸ™‚

## Overview of components

### CLI

#### Shell
My shell is Z-shell[^zsh], prompt is Powerlevel10k[^pk], and my plugins are 
managed with home-manager[^hm], (Oh My ZSH free, and will always be)

#### Terminal
Good ol' Kitty[^kty] with JetBrains Mono Nerd[^jbm]

#### Fetch
Just Macchina[^mc] nothing special, cat is in `ascii.nix` ðŸ™‚

### GUI

#### GTK and Kvantum (QT)
Just using the respective themes from Catppuccin[^cat]

#### Compositor
Hyprland[^hypr], because who doesn't love Hyprland[^hypr]?

#### Bar/Shell
ATM its all yoinked from @fufexan[^fuf], which is built in eww[^eww].
Though don't use my setup as its mostly broken, 
working on a refactor in rust, and a refactor of menu.

#### Display Manager (AKA Login Manager)
Gtkgreet[^gtkg] running under Greetd[^gtd], running under cage[^cage], though 
the styling is pretty broken.

### Media

#### Music
For music I use DownOnSpot[^down] to download my music from 
Spotify (Not using bypass, I'm paying for premium),
which is tagged using beets[^beet], then that music is 
synced with Nextcloud[^ncld], and played through MPD[^mpd], 
which is controlled by ncmpcpp[^nc]

#### Non music (aka video)
I have a basic MPV[^mpv] setup configured, but that's it,
nothing special

### Secrets
NixOS secrets are managed through agenix[^anix]

#### Old home secret stuff
> This does not apply anymore, I use agenix for everything,
but my custom home secrets setup is still there is someone wants

Since agenix[^anix] doesn't support home secrets, nor 
did homeage[^hage] work for me, or work how I wanted it
too, I found it would be faster just to use write my own,
maybe I'll publish and improve my implementation later on

## TODO
- [ ] Add locking, and inhibiting of it
